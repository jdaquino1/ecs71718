                Throughout my life I have been to three different schools.<br>
                The order goes Sabin, Smyser, and currently Lane Tech.<br>
                Most of my school years were at Smyser Elementary,<br>
                so that is the school I graduated 8th grade from.

                            I was only at Sabin for kindergarten and 1st grade. I transferred from Sabin during the 
                            first week of second grade. I don't really have that many memories there, but some memories
                            I do remember is becoming student of the month and getting free Bulls tickets. I also remember
                            my kindergarten graduation and what I wore. But that is basically it since I didn't spend that
                            much time there.

                            After I transferred from Sabin, I went to Smyser. So I was there for 
                            second to eigth grade. I met most of my best friends there and had the best teachers
                            there as well. I played on their Soccer team, cross country team, as well as their track and field team.
                            I was in band for 5th and 6th grade, joinded dance in 7th grade, and did flag corps
                            in 8th grade. Those years were the best years of my life since I was basically able to grow
                            up with my friends until we graduated.

                            Currently I'm a freshmen at Lane Tech. I found out I got into Lane about March of 2017.
                            So far so good. Most of my classes, i'm doing good but Ap Human Geo for me is really hard.
                            I was on the cross country team and i'm on the Let 1 Drill team. I decided not to take gym
                            because I thought about trying something new and ended up loving JROTC. It's so fun, we barely do anything,
                            and it just a close-knit family.
